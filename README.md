# 1.	Application Name:
New Year’s Resolution

# 2.	Project Topic/Objective:
The purpose of this app is to help guide users towards following goals by tracking their
progress and offering feedback if they succeed or fall behind. This app allows the user to
input custom goals giving priority to some goals over others. If the user falls behind on lesser
priority goals the app might recommend dropping those goals to be more efficient. My app
will also recommend goals for the user to follow based on interest if they don’t have any
specific goals in mind. Goals can be input based on a weekly (number of days per week),
daily and monthly basis. When the user inputs data for a goal completed, they can input a
percentage to measure their success and analyze what went right or wrong during a certain
period. Results will be displayed on a graph with the total success rate for each goal on
display separately from the graph. Looking back at past successes and failures will give a
person a better idea of how to plan their goals and to learn from past experiences. Ultimately,
I'm hoping having this information recorded will provide motivation to the user to complete
goals and for the user to plan their goals more realistically. 


# 3.	Motivation:
This topic is of interest to me because I have often fallen behind on goals because I would
take on too much or I wouldn’t keep proper tab of goals. The problem with a lot of planner
apps in my opinion is that they don’t account for failure as a learning experience or the user
doesn’t know how much they can handle realistically. Hence the name New Year’s
Resolution since people often joke about failing their yearly goals but some people don’t
think of failure as a learning experience. There were other ideas I had for potential apps but
this one allowed me to focus more on programming based on user input while other ideas
relied on operating more independently from user input. This topic also allows me to do
research on ways to motivate a user to try harder based on the results of success completing
goals. 

# 4.	Server-Side Components:
User input will be stored in the database to design the graph based on number of goals and on
what timeframe and frequency goals are to be completed. The user will login what percent of
a goal they completed, and these logins will be stored to determine whether the graph goes
up or down.
